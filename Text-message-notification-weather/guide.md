# Introduction: Weather Data Retrieval and Text Message Notification

This project involves the acquisition of weather data using a Weather API, followed by seamless delivery to our mobile devices through Twilio's SMS service. The entire system is hosted on AWS, utilizing its EC2 instances, and operates cost-effectively within the bounds of the AWS Free Tier.

## Project Overview

I set out to create a robust system that not only fetches real-time weather information but also delivers it directly to our mobile phones through text messages. The backbone of this architecture relies on the powerful capabilities of Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly its EC2 instances, providing a scalable and reliable infrastructure for the periodic execution of our weather data service.

## Key Components

1. **Weather API Integration:**
   - Leveraging a Weather API, we seamlessly pull in up-to-the-minute weather data. This ensures the accuracy and timeliness of the information that forms the foundation of our project.

2. **Twilio SMS Service:**
   - Integrating with Twilio, a leading cloud communications platform, our system sends concise and informative weather updates directly to our mobile phones. This not only adds a practical dimension to the project but also demonstrates the versatility of utilizing external services within a data engineering context.

3. **AWS EC2 Instances:**
   - The entire system is hosted on AWS using Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. This ensures a reliable and scalable infrastructure, allowing the service to run periodically without incurring significant costs. The usage falls well within the AWS Free Tier, making it an economical and accessible solution for continuous data delivery.

## Project Objectives

- **Real-Time Updates:** Provide users with accurate and timely weather information.
- **Seamless Integration:** Employ Twilio to seamlessly deliver updates via SMS to mobile devices.
- **Cost-Effective Operation:** Optimize costs by leveraging AWS Free Tier, ensuring the project remains accessible to a wide audience.

This project not only showcases my technical proficiency in data engineering but also underscores my commitment to crafting practical solutions that seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. Join me on this journey as we explore the intricacies of real-time data processing, cloud computing, and efficient communication through the lens of weather updates.
