# Data Engineering Portfolio

I showcase projects highlighting my expertise in data engineering. One project involves integrating weather APIs, Twilio's SMS service, and AWS EC2 for efficient delivery of weather updates via text messages. The second project automates the daily extraction of metrics from YouTube channels using Google Cloud and AWS, employing technologies such as AWS Lambda, S3, EventBridge, Athena, and Glue for comprehensive analysis.
