# Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Engineering Portfolio! Here, I showcase various projects that highlight my passion for using data and technology to solve real-world problems. Each project represents my dedication to learning and innovation in data engineering.

In this portfolio, you'll find projects covering different technologies and areas, with detailed guides and step-by-step instructions. Whether it's integrating APIs, building cloud-based solutions, or automating data workflows, these projects demonstrate my skills and curiosity in turning data into valuable insights.

I mainly use popular cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure, which offer free-tier accounts. This means you can replicate my projects and explore the technologies I've used at no cost.

Feel free to explore the projects, check out the technologies I've used, and see how I've tackled various challenges in data engineering. With each project, I continue to grow and expand my capabilities in this exciting field.
